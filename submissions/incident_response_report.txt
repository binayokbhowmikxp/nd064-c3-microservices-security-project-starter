Executive summary of what happened
Customers complained that they were unable to use our company site as it was too slow and unresponsive. Customers were unable to use the valuable service that 
our esteem company offers.

Summary of what was affected
Three pods running three different crypto miners were launched and the application in kubernetes cluster became very slow in providing response degrading user
experience.

Summary of the impact
The attacker managed to run crypto miners on our system, which is undesirable. Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of CPU. Let's pivot to the Kubernetes/compute resources dashboard to observe the CPU utilization:
Click on the magnifying glass icon on the left-side panel. Search for "Kubernetes/Compute Resources"
We can see that in the last few minutes there is a significant spike in the CPU utilization for both Kubernetes and the default. This is related to the crypto miners being started.

Summary of the remediation steps
The administrator noticed the event through Grafana monitoring and evicted the pods
The Falco Dashboard Udacity in Grafana also begins to show a flat line for crypto-mining-related alerts, as the crypto mining pods are evicted


Summary of lessons learned
We should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards.
It's possible to use admission controllers to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods.
